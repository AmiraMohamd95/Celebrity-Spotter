# Celebrity-Spotter

• Developed a Photo Sharing Platform like Instagram, Posts held tags to public figures, their location, their media attachments whether photo or video, and notify their followers whenever they are tagged, used Ruby on Rails and MongoDB.


• Celebrity tag is matched with the facebook-verified-users by Koala-Facebook-API to select the most correct name.
• Location tag is set by a longitude and a latitude, and other details like (country, city, and address) by the rails geocoder.
• Every user feed is set by his friend's posts, posts that have his current-location, and posts that have tags similar to his preferences from celebrities and locations.
